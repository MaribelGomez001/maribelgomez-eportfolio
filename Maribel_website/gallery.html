	<h3><center>Rager Image</center></h3>
	<p>
		<center>A photo of me with few of my favorite things, I chose a image of me, a character called Oikawa Tooru from "Haiykyuu," animal whiskers, and a halloween candy background to the few things that represent me. I love anime and Oikawa is one of my favorite character from "Haikyuu." Also I really like animals, all type of sweets, and Halloween is my favorite holiday.

	<h3><center>Vetor Image</center></h3>
	<p>
		<center>I used a lot of shapes and effects. The background color I chose was more of a getting-night color, like when the sunset is over and you get to see a bit of the stars. This represents be, in a way, because I personally like it at that hour more than a sunset view. I also like to wear more bold and dark colors than pastels. The most challenging part was starting off because I really didn't know what to draw, but when I let the creative flow, it was nice and fun.

	<h3><center>Audio Project</center></h3>
	<p>
		<center>This audio sample is the sound of me interacting with my pet budgie, singing happily on a peaceful morning. When it comes to beautiful sounds, I think of my budgie (Maxwell) singing, and I decided to use calm and happy music in the background. This audio assignment consists of four audio samples. Although I had to duplicate one audio clip of my budgie toy shaking because the original audio was a bit short. I also fainted out the music towards the end when he finished singing.
